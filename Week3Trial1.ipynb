Most of the times, it is not intentional but because very there is pressure to fix bugs and deploy the code and not necessarily to update the documentation. So you can imagine that our product - DocuMint acts as an agent that scans our codebase at regular intervals and ensures that documentation is available and up to date.\n",

It allows users to select from available podcast RSS feeds, view details about selected podcasts, and add new podcast feeds for processing. The function includes features such as displaying episode titles, summaries, guest information, cover images, and key moments from the podcast episodes.\\n\\n## Input Parameters\\nThe `main` function does not take any input parameters. It operates solely based on user interactions with the Streamlit interface, allowing users to select or input data directly within the application.\\n\\n## Output\\nThe function does not return any output in the traditional sense (e.g., no return value). Instead, it generates a dynamic web interface that displays:\\n- A dropdown menu for selecting available podcasts.\\n- Episode title, summary, and cover image for the selected podcast.\\n- Guest name and details related to the podcast.\\n- Key moments from the podcast episode.\\n- An input box for adding a new podcast RSS feed.\\n- A button to process the new podcast feed.\\n\\nThe output is rendered on a web page using Streamlit components, which include headers, subheaders, text, images, and markdown for enhanced formatting.\\n```',\n",

This allows for easy access to podcast data based on their titles.\\n\\n## Parameters\\n- **folder_path** (str): The path to the folder containing the JSON files. This path should point to a directory where the function can search for all files ending with `.json`.\\n\\n## Returns\\n- **data_dict** (dict): A dictionary where the keys are podcast titles (strings) and the values are the corresponding podcast information (parsed from the JSON files). Each value is expected to be a dictionary containing various details about the podcast as specified in the JSON structure.\\n\\n## Example\\nGiven a folder with JSON files containing podcast information, calling `create_dict_from_json_files(\\'/path/to/folder\\')` would return a dictionary structured as follows:\\n\\n```python\\n{\\n    \"Podcast Title 1\": { ...podcast_info_1... },\\n    \"Podcast Title 2\": { ...podcast_info_2... },\\n    ...\\n}\\n```\\n```\\n',\n",

It utilizes an external function, `process_podcast`, from a service called \"corise-podcast-project\" to retrieve and possibly manipulate podcast data. The function outputs the result of this external call, which likely contains processed podcast details.\\n\\n## Parameters\\n- **url** (str): This parameter represents the URL of the podcast to be processed. It is expected to be a string that points to the location of the podcast resource.\\n\\n## Output\\n- The function returns the output from the `process_podcast` function call. The exact nature of this output is dependent on the implementation of `process_podcast`, but it could include processed podcast information such as metadata, audio files, or other relevant data related to the specified podcast.\\n``` \\n\\nMake sure to replace the placeholder descriptions in the output section with more specific details if you have access to the implementation of the `process_podcast` function.']"

Because the LLM output is highly dependent on the prompt and the information provided in the context window, we also need to take care of validating that this input is secure. The analogy to traditional products is when we need to validate the submitted form values provided by users to prevent any form of SQL injection.

It is an area of active research and each application will measure the quality of response in their own unique way.

They have proven to be reasonably good at judging or comparing the quality especially when using a more capable model (e.g. GPT-4).
